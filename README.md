Here <Malloc_#Fstack>
A Senior High, really that normal. Like knew for even like nothing...
Still learning and for a lot of plans here for future.
Fight 4ever dreams about those stuffs, 'cause pretty awsome, isn't it?

Graduation Plan (Not Really) (like fool huh?)

1. Start updating projects on GitHub, daily engineering stuff, and possibly set up a new EC2 host server. Get an AWS account with superpowers.
2. Learn FL Studio for EDM production. Attend an EDM event if possible, bring classmates/friends (no parents, I need to buy albums!!!! tcs/ptrbs).
3. Dive into BW!!! Cosplay at least twice, once at BW and once on the streets, make friends.
4. For drawing, take lessons from Qingweike. If I get an iPad, learn Procreate.
5. Rhythm games! If someone can guide me through WMC, that would be great!!! It should be fun, a big goal is MaiMai.
6. Back to programming, sign up for "Heima Programmer", Little Frank's courses, AntScape cybersecurity courses, maybe.
7. Catch up on games on my gaming laptop, especially 3A titles like Black Myth, The Witcher, Silent Hill, Cyberpunk, GTA, etc... It will be awesome, play CS2 and PUBG with friends, make new friends.
8. Study hard for advanced math, CET-4/6, TOEFL, IELTS, research full scholarship opportunities for studying abroad, prepare for various competitions like CTF, English, math (National College Math Competition).
9. About circuit design, undecided, maybe learn about mathematical modeling?! Not sure if I can handle it, physics and chemistry are out for now (at least for now).
10. Learn how to bypass the Great Firewall, like Frank, figure out how to set up proxies.
11. Build my own blog.
12. Aim for a perfect GPA, TOEFL, and IELTS scores, apply to schools like CMU.

P.S. Make sure to plan the schedule well, preferably sync with Apple Calendar using Apple ecosystem, it's really good. Use TomatoToDo for daily focus plans.
